blackscholes: 0.843s needs not a lot, L1I/LLC, parallel up to 1 or 2.        :   colocate with others, it takes a very small amount of time.

memcached: cpu L1I Cache, high CPU 0?


Greedy resource alloc: look first at most expensive then less, etc.

2 high cpu
4 high mem
8 standard

timings:

run everything at the same time except canneal
